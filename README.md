# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard!

ðŸš€ Proud to share my latest Interactive Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard! ðŸš€

I had the opportunity to learn this dashboard design from Satish Dhawale, and it has been an incredible experience working on this end-to-end Excel project. This journey has helped me strengthen my data analysis and visualization skills, particularly in healthcare analytics.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights from the Dashboard:
âœ… Patient Admission Status â€“ Admitted vs. not admitted patients
âœ… Patient Age Distribution â€“ Analyzing trends across different age groups
âœ… Timeliness â€“ Measuring the percentage of patients attended within 30 minutes
âœ… Gender Analysis â€“ Understanding the male-to-female patient ratio
âœ… Department Referrals â€“ Identifying which departments receive the most referrals

This project has been a great learning experience in data storytelling, analytical thinking, and Excel dashboard design.
A huge thanks to Satish Dhawale for the mentorship and guidance throughout this journey! Looking forward to exploring more projects and insights.
